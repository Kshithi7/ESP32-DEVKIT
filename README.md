# ESP32 Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my ESP32 DevKit internship repository!  
As part of my internship in IoT and Embedded Systems, I’ve been diving deep into the world of microcontrollers—particularly the **ESP32**, a powerful Wi-Fi + Bluetooth-enabled module. My curiosity to explore real-world applications and control hardware using just a few lines of code led me down this exciting path.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
I started off with the basics of interfacing peripherals and gradually moved into more complex projects involving:
- **WiFi & Bluetooth communication**
- **Sensor integration**
- **Web servers**
- **Cloud & voice-based control systems**
- **Real-time operations with RTC & NTP**

## 🔧 Hardware I'm Using
- ESP32 DevKit v1
- LCD 16x2 (Parallel Interface)
- Buzzer, LEDs, Push Buttons
- RTC Module (DS3231)
- Sensors: LM35, LDR, etc.
- Bluetooth (Built-in)
- Relay module
- Internet modules (for NTP, streaming, etc.)

## 📂 Project Modules
Each project below is documented with code, schematics, and outputs:

| # | Project Title | Description |
|--|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Smart Medicine Reminder](./1_Smart_Medicine_Reminder_ReadMe.md) | Reminder system using RTC, buzzer, LCD, and buttons. |
| 2 | [Menu System + LED Patterns](./2_Menu_LED_Selector_LCD.md) | LCD-based menu to control LED operations using push buttons. |
| 3 | [Online Audio Streaming](./3_Online_Audio_streaming.md) | Streams live audio over a network using ESP32 and a mic module. |
| 4 | [Online Video Streaming](./4_Online_Video_Streaming.md) | Streams video (OpenCV + ESP32 for integration) over local network. |
| 5 | [Google Assistant Relay Control](./5_Google_Assistant_Relay_control.md) | Controls a relay using Google Assistant commands via IFTTT/Firebase. |
| 6 | [RTC with NTP Server](./6_NTP-RTC Update.md)| Displays real-time date & time using NTP server on LCD. |

> 📌 Each project has its own folder and individual `README.md` with wiring, code, output, and what I learned.

## 📸 Sneak Peek
*Diagrams, images, or demo GIFs can go here in the future!*

## 💡 Goals
- Strengthen understanding of real-time embedded systems
- Learn cloud integration with IoT devices
- Build a personal library of reusable ESP32 code
- Work towards building a smart home/health system in the long run

## 🧠 Curiosity Drives Growth!
This repo is more than just code—it's a reflection of my hands-on learning, trial-and-error, and my passion for making tech work in the real world 🌍✨
