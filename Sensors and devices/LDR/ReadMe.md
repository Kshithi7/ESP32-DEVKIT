# ðŸŒž Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)

## ðŸ“– Description
An LDR is a variable resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. It is widely used in:
- Ambient light sensing
- Auto-brightness controls
- Day/night detectors
- Solar tracking systems

## ðŸ”Œ Connections
| LDR Pin   | ESP32 |
|-----------|-------|
| One end   | 3.3V  |
| Other end | GPIO 34 (Analog Input) + 10kÎ© pull-down resistor to GND |

> *Use a voltage divider circuit to read varying voltages from the LDR into an analog pin.*

## ðŸ”§ Voltage Divider Circuit
3.3V --- [ LDR ] ---+--- [ 10kÎ© Resistor ] --- GND | GPIO 34 (Analog input)
